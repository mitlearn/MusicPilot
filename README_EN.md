## 1. Project Overview

MusicPilot is a self-hosted music library automation tool that turns music discovery, resource search, download submission, file organization, metadata completion, library refresh, and playlist sync into one manageable workflow.

It is designed for users who already run their own music library, downloader, and resource sites. MusicPilot does not replace those systems and does not provide download channels. Instead, it connects existing services and reduces repeated manual work around searching, downloading, organizing files, and refreshing the music library.

Core goals:

1. Provide one Web UI for managing music search, downloads, organization, playlists, and music library status.
2. Use a task queue to handle long-running operations, so downloads, scraping, organization, and sync can move forward automatically where possible.
3. Keep deployment simple. SQLite can be used for quick starts, while PostgreSQL is recommended for long-running and production deployments. Docker Compose is supported on NAS devices or servers.
4. Keep clear adapter boundaries so more sites, downloaders, music platforms, metadata sources, and media servers can be added later.

## 3. Features

MusicPilot currently provides the following capabilities:

1. Music search and site search
   - Search music metadata first, then search candidate resources on configured sites based on that metadata.
   - Support site concurrency control, excluded keywords, and result deduplication.
   - Use artist, title, album, and related metadata to help filter candidate results.

2. Download task management
   - Submit selected resources to qBittorrent.
   - Track download status, view download details, and delete download tasks.
   - Trigger downstream organization and music library refresh flows after downloads complete.

3. File organization and metadata handling
   - Support source-directory, mapped-directory, and copy-based organization modes.
   - Support automatic scraping, manual organization, lyrics, and tag writing.
   - Record each file's organization status, failure reason, and actual organization type.

4. Playlist management
   - Import external playlists and manage playlist tracks locally.
   - Search, download, and match local library tracks from playlist entries.
   - Sync local playlists to a Navidrome music library, with selectable sync account and public/private status.

5. Music library and artist library
   - Scan and display music library tracks.
   - Maintain artists, aliases, and merge relationships to improve matching across Chinese names, English names, and aliases.
   - Refresh match status between playlists and the music library.

6. System management
   - Configure sites, downloaders, music libraries, notifications, and system parameters.
   - View logs, dashboard statistics, and file management pages.
   - Control basic deployment parameters through Docker environment variables.

## 5. Screenshots

### 5.1. Dashboard

The dashboard summarizes library size, tracks added in the last 7 days, playlist count, active downloads, organization records, and task queue health. The recent downloads and recent organization sections make it easier to confirm whether automation is progressing normally and whether failed tasks need manual handling.

![MusicPilot dashboard](docs/assets/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### 5.2. Search and Site Selection

The search page shows music metadata candidates first, then asks the user to confirm which sites should be searched. The confirmation dialog keeps the media details and album list visible so the title, artist, and album clues can be checked before submitting a site search.

![MusicPilot search](docs/assets/screenshots/search.png)

### 5.3. Download Tasks

The downloads page shows submitted tasks with their status, progress, save path, and actions. Users can refresh task status, filter active tasks, open task details, or delete records that are no longer needed.

### 5.4. File Management

The file management page is used to browse source files or target music library directories. It supports directory switching, file search, list refresh, batch organization, and deletion. Each file or directory keeps its type, size, modification time, and organization actions so users can manually intervene in the automated organization flow.

#### 5.4.1. Metadata Viewer

Audio files in File Management support on-demand metadata viewing. The detail dialog brings together the embedded cover, file information, title, artist, album, year, track number, duration, bitrate, sample rate, channels, and lyrics so the file can be checked before organization.

### 5.5. Playlist Management

The playlists page shows the local state of imported external playlists, including source platform, track count, existing tracks, pending tracks, submitted tasks, failures, and sync status. Public playlists from QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, Kuwo Music, Kugou Music, Spotify, and Apple Music can be imported from shared links. The action area provides entry points for details, match refresh, download submission, sync, and deletion.

### 5.6. System Settings

The settings page groups runtime parameters by downloader, music library, notification, and system settings. System settings include proxy configuration, scraping switches, source directory, mapped directory, and missing-field handling, which control resource organization and metadata completion behavior.

## 6. Quick Start

Published Docker images are recommended for running MusicPilot on a NAS or server. Build from source only when you need to modify or debug the project locally.

### 6.1. Deploy With Published Docker Images

MusicPilot publishes the same multi-architecture image to Docker Hub and GHCR. Set the MusicPilot service's `image` field in your Compose file to either address:

```yaml
# Docker Hub
image: lzcer/musicpilot:latest

# GHCR
image: ghcr.io/lzcer/musicpilot:latest
```

Both images support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### 6.2. Build From Source

The following workflow builds and runs MusicPilot directly from source.

1. Clone the project and enter the directory:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> MusicPilot
cd MusicPilot
```

2. Update the key values in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8000:8000"
volumes:
  - /volume1/docker/musicpilot/data:/data
  - /volume1/docker/musicpilot/config:/config
  - /volume1/media:/media
environment:
  TZ: Asia/Shanghai
  MP_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
  MP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: change-this-password
  MP_SESSION_SECRET: change-this-random-secret
```

The `/volume1/media` directory should contain `music` and `downloads` as subdirectories. When using the repository `.env` file, replace `MP_HOST_MUSIC_PATH` and `MP_HOST_DOWNLOADS_PATH` with:

```dotenv
MP_HOST_MEDIA_PATH=/volume1/media
```

Mount the common parent directory once instead of mounting the two subdirectories separately. Hardlinks require the source and target to be on the same filesystem and under the same container mount. A single physical disk, storage pool, or NAS volume does not guarantee this; separate Docker mounts, filesystems, or Btrfs subvolumes still prevent hardlink creation and cause MusicPilot to fall back to copying.

After the first startup, set the scraping source directory to `/media/downloads` and the mapped directory to `/media/music` in the Web UI system settings.

For an existing deployment, place the original library and download directories under the shared host parent before restarting the container, then update the scraping source directory, mapped directory, and downloader local path in the Web UI. Changing the mount configuration does not move existing files automatically.

If the Docker build container cannot reach PyPI while the host network works normally, keep:

```yaml
build:
  network: host
```

If you need a more stable Python package mirror, adjust:

```yaml
build:
  args:
    UV_DEFAULT_INDEX: https://pypi.org/simple
```

3. Build and start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

4. Open the Web UI:

```text
http://<NAS_IP>:8000
```

5. View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f musicpilot
```

6. Update the project:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 6.3. Recommended PostgreSQL Database

MusicPilot can start quickly with SQLite, but PostgreSQL is recommended for long-running and production deployments. Download polling, task queues, playlist sync, library refreshes, and database backups continuously write runtime data, and PostgreSQL is more reliable for concurrency, recovery, and maintenance.

If PostgreSQL already exists, change `MP_DATABASE_URL` in `docker-compose.yml` to a PostgreSQL connection string:

```yaml
MP_DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://musicpilot:change-this-password@postgres:5432/musicpilot
```

Create the PostgreSQL database and user before starting MusicPilot. On startup, MusicPilot runs Alembic to initialize or upgrade the schema.

To run PostgreSQL in the same Compose project, add a `postgres` service and make MusicPilot depend on it:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: musicpilot
      POSTGRES_USER: musicpilot
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: change-this-password
    volumes:
      - ./postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  musicpilot:
    environment:
      MP_DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://musicpilot:change-this-password@postgres:5432/musicpilot
    depends_on:
      - postgres
```

### 6.4. Configuration Guide

After the first startup, configure sites, downloaders, music libraries, organization rules, and notification channels in the Web UI.

Configuration guide entry: [MusicPilot Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.en.md)

This document covers startup environment variables, site parsers, site accounts, downloaders, music libraries, scraping, search, notifications, and database backup steps.
